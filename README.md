ACSensoric (Arduino Capacitive Sensoric)

This can be used with an Arduino where you register multiple capacitive sensors with a trigger treshold to trigger specific actions. In this case it is used for midi output.

The project ist based on [this](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor) Arduino playground which also can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CapacitiveSensor).

To use this sketch remember to include the necessary header file from the CapacitiveSensor project.
